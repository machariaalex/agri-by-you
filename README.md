This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Admin dashboard & CRM

`/admin` is a password-protected dashboard for running the business:

- **CRM**: leads (website contact form submissions land here automatically), customers, partners & suppliers, each with an activity log for calls, WhatsApps, visits and notes.
- **Sales**: orders with line items, payments and balances, plus a product price list (KES).
- **Website**: journal articles, services, projects and testimonials. Saving refreshes the public pages.

Data lives in Neon Postgres (provisioned through the Vercel Marketplace on the `agri-by-you` project) and is accessed with Drizzle ORM.

### Setup

```bash
vercel env pull .env.local          # DATABASE_URL, SESSION_SECRET, …
npm run db:migrate                  # apply migrations in ./drizzle
npm run db:seed                     # load the original site content (only fills empty tables)
npm run admin:create -- you@example.com "Your Name"   # prints a generated password
npm run dev                         # then open http://localhost:3000/admin
```

After changing `src/db/schema.ts`, run `npm run db:generate` and commit the new migration. More admins can be added from **Admin → Settings**.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
